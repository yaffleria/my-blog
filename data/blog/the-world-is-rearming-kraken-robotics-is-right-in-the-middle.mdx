### The \$2.7 Trillion Shift

The world spent a record \$2.7 trillion on military defense in 2024, a 9.4% jump driven by conflicts in Ukraine, Taiwan, and the Middle East. This spending isn't just for tanks; it's heavily focused on the ocean floor, where undersea cables are being cut and unmanned systems are becoming critical. Kraken Robotics, a small Canadian company, sits right in the middle of this trend, making the essential parts everyone needs.

### Global Rearmament

Global military spending has risen 21% since 2020, with NATO Europe finally waking up and increasing budgets by 35%. The US Navy alone has allocated \$5.3 billion for drones in 2026, with a significant chunk for underwater UUVs. This shift towards unmanned systems is where Kraken shines, supplying the batteries and sonar that these robots cannot run without.

### Geopolitical Hotspots

Tensions are boiling in the South China Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Arctic. In the Baltic, key underwater cables have been slashed, prompting NATO to launch "Baltic Sentry" to guard infrastructure with drone swarms. In the Arctic, melting ice is opening new routes that Russia and China want to control, giving Canada-based Kraken a geographic home advantage.

### The AUKUS Catalyst

The AUKUS alliance is a game-changer, specifically for the "Ghost Shark" autonomous submarine program being built by Anduril. Australia has committed \$1.7 billion to this project, and Kraken is supplying the battery modules. With production starting in 2026, this partnership validates Kraken's tech on a massive scale.

### The Picks and Shovels Play

During the Gold Rush, the real money was made by selling jeans and pickaxes, not digging for gold. Kraken is running the same playbook by selling core components like SeaPower batteries and AquaPix sonar to every drone manufacturer. Whether it's Anduril, Lockheed, or Kongsberg who wins the platform war, they all need the parts Kraken builds.

### The Thesis vs Risks

The bull case rests on prolonged geopolitical tension and AUKUS execution, which would make Kraken a bottleneck in a massive megatrend. While risks like peace treaties or competition from giants like Teledyne exist, Kraken's explosive revenue growth and strategic position make it a high-potential bet on the future of naval warfare.

### The Bottom Line

The logic is simple: the world is arming up, navies need underwater automation, and those robots need Kraken's components. We are not betting on a single platform but on the industry-wide necessity of their tech. As long as military budgets climb and undersea infrastructure remains vulnerable, Kraken is positioned to win.
