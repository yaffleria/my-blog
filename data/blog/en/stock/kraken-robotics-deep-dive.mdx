The naval strategy of the Western alliance, centered around the US, Australia, and the UK (AUKUS), is rapidly shifting from "Manned Submarines" to <strong>Unmanned Autonomous Systems</strong>. Behind this massive current, Kraken Robotics (hereafter Kraken) is solidifying its position not as a platform manufacturer, but as an <strong>Exclusive Supplier of Mission-Critical Subsystems</strong>.

In this article, we analyze Kraken's technical moat, partnership status, and 2025 financial outlook based on concrete figures and facts.

## Technical Moat: Why Kraken?

For Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) to be deployed in actual operations, they must overcome two physical limitations: "<strong>How long can it endure? (Energy)</strong>" and "<strong>How accurately can it see? (Sensing)</strong>". Kraken has secured a clear technical advantage in these two areas compared to its competitors.

### SeaPower™: The Deep-Sea Energy Solution

Traditional deep-sea batteries required heavy and expensive titanium pressure vessels to withstand water pressure, or used oil-filled pressure compensation methods. Kraken's <strong>SeaPower™</strong> is different.

| Feature            | Traditional Battery (Lead-Acid/Li-ion) | Kraken SeaPower™                             |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**      | Pressure Vessel Required (Heavy)       | **Pressure-Neutral** (Polymer Encapsulation) |
| **Energy Density** | Low (Includes vessel weight)           | **Max 260 Wh/l** (High Density)              |
| **Depth Rating**   | Limited (Dependent on vessel specs)    | Standard **6,000m** (Max 10,000m)            |
| **Maintenance**    | Complex (Risk of oil leakage)          | Simple (Modular replacement)                 |

Kraken encapsulates battery cells directly with a special polymer, allowing them to withstand 6,000m pressure without a separate pressure vessel. This drastically reduces the weight of the UUV, thereby extending mission endurance.

### AquaPix®: 3cm Ultra-High Resolution Sonar

<strong>Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS)</strong> is Kraken's foundational and core technology. While
the resolution of traditional Side Scan Sonar degrades rapidly with distance, SAS maintains a
constant resolution regardless of range through advanced signal processing.

- **Resolution**: Range-independent **3cm x 3cm** (Up to **1.9cm x 2.1cm** with Ultra HD SW)
- **Area Coverage Rate (ACR)**: **4~5.3 km²/h** (2-3x faster than traditional sonar)
- **Application**: deployable on both manned/unmanned platforms (HII REMUS, Anduril Dive-LD, etc.)

## Partnership Ecosystem: Who are they selling to?

Kraken's customers are global "Tier 1" defense contractors. Kraken's components are "spec-in" (integrated into the specifications) for the large-scale projects these giants win.

### Anduril Industries (Strategic Partner)

Anduril, often called the "Tesla of Defense," is Kraken's most critical partner.

- **Dive-LD (Large Displacement)**: Anduril's long-range autonomous underwater vehicle. Kraken's batteries, sonar, thrusters, and other core components are integrated as a package.
- **Ghost Shark (XL-AUV)**: A massive project worth **AUD &#36;1.7 Billion (approx. USD &#36;1.12B)** signed between the Royal Australian Navy and Anduril. Under this 5-year contract signed in 2025, Kraken supplies large-format battery modules. Initial prototypes (3 units) were already delivered in 2024, with production models scheduled for delivery starting in 2026.

### HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)

Kraken also maintains a deep relationship with HII, a major UUV supplier to the US Navy.

- **REMUS Series**: Kraken sonar is mounted on the REMUS series, the most widely sold UUV globally.
- **New Integration**: Kraken's MINSAS sonar is offered as a standard payload option for the latest models, **REMUS 620** and **MK18 Mod 2**. Starting with an initial integration order of &#36;1M in 2023, volumes are expanding.

## 2025 Financial Guidance

Kraken is not just an R&D company. It has already achieved profitability and is showing a steep growth curve (J-Curve).

### Guidance Summary (2025 Outlook)

- **Revenue**: **&#36;120 Million ~ &#36;135 Million** (Approx. **+40%** growth vs 2024)
- **EBITDA**: **&#36;26 Million ~ &#36;34 Million** (Approx. **+45%** growth vs 2024)
- **CAPEX**: &#36;20M ~ &#36;21M (New battery factory expansion, etc.)

### Qualitative Shift in Revenue

The proportion of **RaaS (Robotics as a Service)** and service revenue is increasing relative to simple product sales. This generates recurring revenue rather than one-time margins, acting as a driving force to maintain gross margins in the 40-50% range.

## Risk Factors

Risks that must be considered before investing.

- **Geopolitical Dependence**: The majority of revenue comes from defense and security budgets. Growth could slow if global tensions ease.
- **Supply Chain Issues**: Risks regarding raw material supply (battery cells, etc.) or delays in capacity expansion.
- **Intensifying Competition**: The possibility of traditional defense firms like Kongsberg or Thales developing their own in-house technologies cannot be ruled out.

## Conclusion: Top-down Perspective

The increase in global defense budgets, specifically the **Maritime Unmanned Budget (&#36;5.3B+)**, is an irresistible Megatrend. In this flow, Kraken Robotics is the most tangible beneficiary, supplying "components that are needed regardless of who wins."

Whenever Anduril's Ghost Shark patrols the Australian coast, or a NATO navy scans for mines with REMUS, Kraken generates revenue.
