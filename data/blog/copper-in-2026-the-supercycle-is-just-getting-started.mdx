### The New Oil

That's what Goldman Sachs is calling copper now, and they might be right. Oil powered the 20th century, but copper will power the 21st—every AI chip, EV, wind turbine, and solar panel rely on it. We are looking at a structural shift where supply is stuck while demand is about to explode, creating a perfect storm for a supercycle.

### AI & Green Energy Demand

Demand is driven by electricity consumption, which is skyrocketing due to two massive trends: AI data centers and green energy. A single ChatGPT query uses 10x the power of a Google search, and AI data centers alone will add 1 million tons of copper demand by 2030. Meanwhile, EVs require 4x more copper than gas cars, and renewable energy farms need 5x more per megawatt than fossil fuel plants.

### The Supply Crisis

While demand surges, supply is faltering because the major mines in Chile and Peru are aging, with declining ore grades and rising costs. Opening a new mine now takes an average of 15 years due to regulations and permits, meaning miners can't just "dig more" to meet demand. The shutdown of Cobre Panama, which provided 1.5% of global supply, proves how fragile the supply chain is.

### $10,000 Floor

Wall Street is aggressively raising price targets, with Goldman and Citi predicting a breakout to \$12,000/ton as inventories run dry in late 2026. Given the supply-demand deficit, \$10,000/ton is looking less like a ceiling and more like the new floor, with some forecasts reaching \$15,000 by 2030.

### How to Play: FCX vs SCCO

Mining stocks offer operating leverage, meaning their profits rise faster than copper prices. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is the top pick for growth, being a pure-play producer with massive assets in the US and Indonesia. Southern Copper (SCCO) offers stability with the world's largest reserves and higher dividends, but it trades at a richer valuation with less immediate upside potential.

### The Bottom Line

The thesis is simple math: AI and renewables are driving structural demand growth while aging mines and long lead times constrain supply. This deficit will inevitably lead to a price surge and a supercycle. While short-term volatility from recession fears or China's economy is expected, the long-term direction for copper is clear—are you positioned for it?
