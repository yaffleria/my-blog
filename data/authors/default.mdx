Hello, I'm Charlotte.

I've been investing for about 10 years now. I'm not a professional investor or a finance industry insider. I'm just an ordinary office worker earning a salary. However, I started studying investing long ago with the goal of "building wealth for my family," and I started this blog to organize what I've learned along the way.

There was a time when I was obsessed with self-development books, thinking that "increasing my own value" was the only answer. That's not wrong, of course. But as time went on, I realized that building assets for myself and my family is equally important.

When I first started investing, I was lost. I didn't know where to start or who to trust. YouTube algorithms only showed me sensational thumbnails, and communities were full of confirmation bias. Eventually, I decided that the only way was to read and study for myself.

And so, 10 years have passed. I've been helped by various contents along the way. I read global market news every morning to grasp the market flow, and I learned investment perspectives and mindsets from individual investors' contents like Joseph Carlson.

I mainly invest in US stocks, ETFs, and REITs. In pension accounts where direct investment is difficult, I choose to invest indirectly in the US market through domestic listed ETFs. I aim for long-term investment, utilize various tax-saving accounts, and pay attention to financial products and tax changes.

I am interested in companies with economic moats that competitors cannot easily follow, structural growth drivers that expand the market, and reasonable valuations. Of course, my judgment is not always right. I've made many mistakes, and I will make more. That's why I try to leave my thoughts and flows of the moment on this blog. It's to remember "why I thought that way" when I look back later.

Feedback or questions about the blog content are always welcome.
