Hi, I'm Charlotte.

I'm not a financial professional. I'm just an enthusiast who enjoys piecing together the puzzle of the market.

I invest mainly in US stocks and ETFs, looking for economic moats and reasonable valuations. This blog is simply an archive of my logic and "finished puzzles."

For real-time insights and casual chats, find me on X.
